            <p class="lead">If you want to try Live++ in one of your projects straight away and deal with the details later, simply follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Make sure the <strong>LivePP</strong> folder is stored in a location within your project hierarchy.</li>
              <li>Set up <a href="#compiler_settings">compiler options</a> and <a href="#linker_settings">linker options</a> for your project.</li>
              <li>Create a default agent and enable Live++ for all loaded modules using the following code:</li>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// include the API for Windows, 64-bit, C++
#include "LivePP/API/x64/LPP_API_x64_CPP.h"

int main(void)

  // ...
  Application::Exec();

  // destroy the Live++ agent
  lpp::LppDestroyDefaultAgent(&lppAgent);

}
</code></pre>
              <li>Start your application, modify your source files with your application of choice, save your changes, and hit <kbd><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>F11</kbd></kbd> to invoke the Live++ hot-reload.</li>
            </ol>

          <section>
            <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
            <p class="lead">Alternatively, take a look at the examples that ship with Live++. They come with ready-made solutions and projects for Visual Studio 2017, 2019, and 2022, and demonstrate the various features that Live++ has to offer, allowing you to experiment without having to set up anything yourself.</p>

            <h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
            <p class="lead">Live++ doesn't require a lengthy installation process. It is completely self-contained: just copy the whole directory tree to any location on your hard drive. Naturally, you may upload the Live++ folders to any version control system you use to keep track of your project.</p>

            <h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>
            <p class="lead">To keep the impact on target applications as low as possible and enable features like networked hot-reload, Live++ is split into several processes and modules.</p>
          </header>

          <section>
            <h2 id="broker">Broker</h2>
            <p>The Broker is Live++'s main application process. It operates as a server which Live++'s Agents connect to. It is a long-running application that should be started once and kept running: there's no need to restart it every time you close or re-open the target application(s). Additionally, the Broker stores internal caches of Live++'s required files such as those in .pdb and .obj format, greatly improving loading times where only parts of an application have changed between restarts.</p>
            <p>For local connections, the Broker will be started automatically as soon as the Live++ Agent is loaded into the target application.</p>

            <div class="callout callout-info-MM" role="alert">
              <h4>Note</h4>
              <p>
                When the Broker is spawned by the Live++ Agent/Bridge, it uses <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/process-creation-flags" target="_blank">CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB</a> as one of its process creation flags. This ensures that even though the process which loads the Live++ Agent might use a job object to control whether all its descendant processes should automatically close as soon as the parent closes via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-jobobject_basic_limit_information" target="_blank">JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE</a>, the Live++ Broker will stay open.
              </p>
              <p>
                This implies that client code using a job object needs to use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-jobobject_basic_limit_information" target="_blank">JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK</a> in its limit flags.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>Because the Broker acts as a server listening for incoming connections on a specific port, multiple Brokers are only allowed to run simultaneously as long as each of them uses a different port for communication, which can be configured in the <a href="#global_preferences_network">global preferences</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="agent">Agent</h2>
            <p>The Agent is responsible for carrying out tasks as dictated by the Broker or Bridge. The Agent ships as a small shared library (e.g. .dll on Windows and Xbox) which is loaded into the target application when creating any of the available agents through the corresponding API.</p>
            <p>This approach makes it possible to use Live++ on modules that are loaded into completely arbitrary target applications, even applications which do not know anything about Live++ and do not have any hot-reload capabilities built-in, such as <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/NativePlugins.html" target="_blank">Unity Native plug-ins</a>, <a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2022/ENU/?guid=Maya_SDK_A_First_Plugin_cpp_HelloWorldComplete_html" target="_blank">Autodesk Maya plug-ins</a>, and countless others.</p>

            <div class="callout callout-info-MM" role="alert">
              <h4>Example</h4>
              <p>Live++ ships with an example named <strong>"13_ArbitraryTarget"</strong> that demonstrates this.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="bridge">Bridge</h2>
            <p>On certain platforms (e.g. Windows and Xbox), the Bridge acts as an intermediate process between Agent and Broker, and is required for providing features like networked hot-reload, since the Broker does not necessarily run on the same machine as the Agent. However, the Bridge should be completely transparent to you as a user.</p>

            <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
            <p>Agent and Bridge communicate with each other via Named Duplex Pipes, since they always run on the same machine.</p>
            <p>Bridge and Broker communicate with each other via TCP/IP using the host name or IP address configured in the <a href="#global_preferences_network">global preferences</a> on port 12216.</p>

            <h1 id="project_setup">Project setup</h1>
            <p class="lead">Live++ does not require any special project setup, except for a few compiler and linker settings. It is perfectly fine to use any mix of static libraries (.lib) and dynamic libraries (.dll) in your projects and solutions. Live++ will automatically extract the needed information from all object files and executables involved.</p>

            <h3 id="linker_settings_lld_link">lld-link</h3>
            <p><strong>lld-link</strong> is fully compatible with the MSVC/Visual Studio linker options. Therefore, code linked using <strong>lld-link</strong> must use the same options as above.</p>

            <div class="callout callout-info-MM" role="alert">
              <h4>Example</h4>
              <p>Live++ ships with an example named <strong>"09_ClangLLD"</strong> that demonstrates how to use Clang as your compiler and LLD as your linker.</p>
            </div>


            <h2 id="incompatible_settings">Incompatible settings</h2>
            <p>While Live++ allows you to build code with almost any combination of compiler and linker options, turning on <span class="label label-default label-custom-MM">C/C++ -> Optimization -> Whole Program Optimization</span> or any kind of Link Time Code Generation (LTCG) or Link Time Optimization (LTO) is not supported. Object files built using LTCG/LTO store information in an unsupported proprietary format and cannot be used by Live++.</p>
            <div class="callout callout-info-MM" role="alert">
              <h4>Note</h4>
              <p>Live++ will automatically detect incompatible compiler and linker settings and output an error accordingly.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="required_files">Required files</h2>
            <p>
              In order to load and reconstruct the necessary information for a module, Live++ needs the following files to be present:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>PDB files for all Live++-enabled modules:</strong><br/>PDB files contain useful information about executable image sections, public symbols, and the translation units and toolchains involved.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Object files (.obj) that were linked into Live++-enabled modules:</strong><br/>Almost all of the symbol information needed by Live++ is extracted and reconstructed from object files.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Source files (.cpp &amp; .h) used to compile the above-mentioned object files.</strong>
                </li>
              </ul>
              You may find your project uses libraries which you don't have the source code for (e.g. 3rd-party code) or the object files for (e.g. Visual Studio's C &amp; C++ runtimes). This is not an issue: Live++ will simply ignore the corresponding translation units.
            </p>

            <h2 id="supported_setups">Supported setups</h2>
            <p>
              Live++ fully supports .exe, .dll, and .lib projects, makefile-based projects, and custom setups and build systems. From a technical point of view, Live++ does not care about what type of project it is used in. In fact, Live++ does not even know about the project type at all.<br/>
              Nevertheless, different project types will exhibit different behaviours between coding sessions:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Application (.exe) projects:</strong><br/>
                  Live++ will recompile .obj files using the original compiler command-line options and generate a patch to be loaded into the address space of the running process, run-time linking against existing symbols. The .exe will be compiled and linked again by the native toolchain automatically between two Live++ sessions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Dynamic library (.dll) projects:</strong><br/>
                  Similar to application projects, individual .obj files will be recompiled. The .dll will be automatically compiled and linked again by the native toolchain between sessions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Static library (.lib) projects:</strong><br/>
                  Similar to application projects, individual .obj files that are part of a .lib file will be recompiled. However, Live++ does not link static libraries that contain these .obj files. Between two Live++ sessions, the native toolchain will first compile and link all .lib files containing recompiled object files and then re-link all applications and dynamic libraries that consume these .lib files.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Makefile-based projects:</strong><br/>
                  Similar to any of the above, depending on what the makefile contains.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Custom setups and build systems:</strong><br/>
                  Similar to any of the above, depending on what is built using your setup.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <div class="callout callout-info-MM" role="alert">
              <h4>Note</h4>
              <p>In addition to Visual Studio, Live++ has also been tested with
                <a href="https://www.fastbuild.org/docs/home.html" target="_blank">FASTBuild</a>, <a href="https://www.incredibuild.com/" target="_blank">IncrediBuild</a>,
                <a href="https://www.snsystems.com/tech-blog/2014/01/06/building-with-the-network/" target="_blank">SN-DBS</a>, various in-house (distributed) build systems, and build systems used by other IDEs such as <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/#section=windows" target="_blank">CLion</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/#section=windows" target="_blank">Rider</a>, or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>. Depending on how your build is structured, you may need to configure some settings first to ensure Live++ finds all the necessary files and toolchains.</p>
            </div>


            <h3 id="FASTBuild">FASTBuild</h3>
            <p>
              When using FASTBuild as your build system, no special configuration is necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              The only exception to this rule is when using distributed compilation in conjunction with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/fi-name-forced-include-file" target="_blank">/FI compiler option</a>. In this case, FASTBuild will preprocess individual translation units locally and then distribute them among remote agents, however removing the /FI option when doing so. As a result, this /FI option will be missing from the produced PDB file, possibly making recompilation using Live++ fail.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this case, the /FI option has to be supplied to Live++ via the additional command-line options that can be specified in the <a href=#project_preferences_compiler>project preferences</a>.
            </p>

            <div class="callout callout-info-MM" role="alert">
              <h4>Example</h4>
              <p>Live++ ships with an example named <strong>11_FASTBuild</strong> that demonstrates this.</p>
            </div>


            <h3 id="IncrediBuild">IncrediBuild</h3>
            <p>
              When using distributed builds in conjunction with precompiled header files, IncrediBuild may generate several individual PDBs (e.g. <strong>C:\Project\SourceFile_cpp_ib_1.pdb, C:\Project\SourceFile_cpp_ib_2.pdb, etc.</strong>) that all use the same precompiled header (e.g. <strong>C:\Project\PCH.pch</strong>) that was built against a different PDB. Strictly speaking, this is neither allowed nor supported by Microsoft's compiler toolchain, and will lead to Live++ yielding <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-2/compiler-error-c2858" target="_blank">error C2858</a> when trying to recompile.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this case, you need to make use of the <a href="#project_preferences_compiler">"Force use of precompiled header PDBs"</a> setting in order to force Live++ to use the same PDB as the corresponding PCH when recompiling files.
            </p>


            <h3 id="distributed_builds">Distributed builds</h3>
            <p>
              When using distributed compilation, the build system will copy the compiler executable and all required auxiliary files to a remote machine, start the compilation process on the remote machine, and copy the output back to the machine that initiated the build. In this case, the PDB file that is used by Live++ in order to find the compiler and linker executables will contain paths on remote machines, e.g. <strong>C:\Users\Jane\AppData\Local\Temp\.fbuild.tmp\worker\toolchain.130589cdf35aed3b\cl.exe</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since this path is not available when recompiling files using Live++, you must make use of the <a href="#project_preferences_compiler">"Override compiler path"</a> setting and tell Live++ where a local compiler can be found.          
            </p>

            <h3 id="creating_default_agent">Creating a default agent</h3>
            <p>For most applications and projects, the first thing to do is to create a default agent:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// include the API for Windows, 64-bit, C++
#include "LivePP/API/x64/LPP_API_x64_CPP.h"

int main(void)
{
  // create a default agent, loading the Live++ agent from the given path, e.g. "ThirdParty/LivePP"
  lpp::LppDefaultAgent lppAgent = lpp::LppCreateDefaultAgent(nullptr, absoluteOrRelativePathWithoutTrailingSlash);

  // bail out in case the agent is not valid
  if (!lpp::LppIsValidDefaultAgent(&lppAgent))
  {
    return 1;
  }

  // enable Live++ for certain modules
  // ...

  // run the application
  // ...
  Application::Exec();

  // destroy the Live++ agent
  lpp::LppDestroyDefaultAgent(&lppAgent);

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Internally, this loads the correct shared library for the requested platform and language, and performs a few integrity checks before filling the returned object with all available APIs. The returned <strong><code class="language-cpp">LppDefaultAgent</code></strong> object is a platform-independent type that stores APIs in the shared library using function pointers.</p>

            <p>Note how in the example code above, the default agent does not need to know anything about a main loop, engine frames, or similar.
              The advantage of this approach is that it integrates beautifully with applications that don't follow the typical <strong>Update, Render, Present</strong> loop like games and game engines do, and therefore works with event-based applications e.g. built using <a href="https://www.qt.io" target="_blank">Qt</a>.
              One disadvantage of this approach is that you cannot control at which point in time Live++ applies its code patches. If you need this kind of control, use a synchronized agent instead.
            </p>

            <div class="callout callout-info-MM" role="alert">
              <h4>Note</h4>
              <p>
                On certain platforms (e.g. Windows and Xbox), the Agent will automatically spawn the <a href="#bridge">Bridge</a> helper process - there is no need to start it manually.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h3 id="creating_synchronized_agent">Creating a synchronized agent</h3>
            <p>Particularly useful for frame-based applications, a synchronized agent allows you to control <strong>when</strong> and <strong>how</strong> hot-reload and hot-restart requests are handled:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// include the API for Windows, 64-bit, C++
#include "LivePP/API/x64/LPP_API_x64_CPP.h"

int main(void)
{
  // create a synchronized agent, loading the Live++ agent from the given path, e.g. "ThirdParty/LivePP"
  lpp::LppSynchronizedAgent lppAgent = lpp::LppCreateSynchronizedAgent(nullptr, absoluteOrRelativePathWithoutTrailingSlash);

  // bail out in case the agent is not valid
  if (!lpp::LppIsValidSynchronizedAgent(&lppAgent))
  {
    return 1;
  }

  // enable Live++ for certain modules
  // ...

  // run the main loop
  while (MainLoop::NextFrame())
  {
    // listen to hot-reload and hot-restart requests
    if (lppAgent.WantsReload())
    {
      // client code can do whatever it wants here, e.g. synchronize across several threads, the network, etc.
      // ...
      lppAgent.CompileAndReloadChanges(lpp::LPP_RELOAD_BEHAVIOUR_WAIT_UNTIL_CHANGES_ARE_APPLIED);
    }

    if (lppAgent.WantsRestart())
    {
      // client code can do whatever it wants here, e.g. finish logging, abandon threads, etc.
      // ...
      lppAgent.Restart(lpp::LPP_RESTART_BEHAVIOUR_INSTANT_TERMINATION, 0u);
    }

    MainLoop::Update();
    MainLoop::Render();
    MainLoop::Present();
  }

  // destroy the Live++ agent
  lpp::LppDestroySynchronizedAgent(&lppAgent);

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Similar to a default agent, the returned <strong><code class="language-cpp">LppSynchronizedAgent</code></strong> object is a platform-independent type that stores APIs in the shared library using function pointers.</p>

            <p>
              Synchronized agents can be used to ensure that code patches only happen at a certain point during a frame, e.g. either at the start or end of a frame. This is crucial when supporting <a href="#API_structural_change">structural changes</a>, since this prevents objects allocated using an old memory layout being accessed using new code that expects a different memory layout.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, using a synchronized agent also makes sure that functions won't be patched mid-frame, which could cause slight behavourial drift between e.g. objects that were updated using the old code and those that were updated using the new code. The following example illustrates this:
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
void UpdateNumber(float deltaTime, size_t index)
{
  g_numbers[index] += 1.0f*deltaTime;
}

void Update(float deltaTime)
{
  for (size_t i = 0u; i < numberCount; ++i)
  {
    UpdateNumber(deltaTime, i);
  }
}</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              Consider what happens when <strong><code class="language-cpp">void UpdateNumber(float deltaTime, size_t index)</code></strong> is changed while the loop in <strong><code class="language-cpp">void Update(float deltaTime)</code></strong> is executing. In this case, some of the numbers would be updated using the old code, while the remainder - those processed after the change - would be updated using the new code. This is probably not an issue in the majority of cases, but if it is, synchronized agents can ensure that your process is held until all code patches are applied.
            </p>

            <div class="callout callout-info-MM" role="alert">
              <h4>Note</h4>
              <p>Whether you use a synchronized agent or not, the actual patching of executable code is always done in a safe manner by Live++. This means the CPU will never see an instruction torn in two at the machine code level.</p>
            </div>


            <h2 id="enabling_livepp">Enabling Live++</h2>

              <p>
                When working with DLLs, it is crucial to <strong>never</strong> call any of these APIs in your DllMain entry point. <br/>Live++ needs to perform a few operations that are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-best-practices" target="_blank">not supported by the operating system</a> while DLLs are being loaded, which could lead to a deadlock.

            <p>When calling these APIs, you must ensure the module(s) in question are already loaded into the process. The APIs themselves are non-blocking, thread-safe, and can be called from any thread at any time. Expected paths can either be absolute paths, or paths relative to the module that calls these APIs.</p>

              <h4>Hint</h4>
              <p>
                Even if not strictly necessary, it is recommended to enable Live++ as early as possible in your application, ideally right at the start of your main entry point. This allows the Broker to start loading and analyzing your files concurrent with your application, maximizing startup performance. Even on AAA-sized projects, the performance impact on the target application should be minimal.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              Note that Live++ starts reading and analyzing files after any of the <strong><code class="language-cpp">Enable*</code></strong> APIs have been called, but the time at which you call these APIs is totally up to you. If you feel that Live++ creates unwanted wait times on your machine (e.g. due to very large PDBs or non-SSD drives) and you don't want to sit through them on each application startup, it is perfectly fine to load Live++ only when it is needed.<br/>
              
              In this case, you might find it beneficial to only load and enable Live++ manually, using a keyboard shortcut, in-game console, debug menu, etc.
            </p>


            <h2 id="dynamically_loaded_modules">Dynamically loaded modules</h2>
            <p>Should you dynamically load and unload modules at runtime, you have to tell Live++ that modules need to be disabled before unloading them. This can be done with several Agent APIs:</p>

            <div class="table-responsive">
              <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
                <thead>

                    <th>API</th>
                    <th>Description</th>

                </thead>

                    <td>Disables Live++ for the given module (.exe or .dll) with the given options, filtering modules using an optional callback function and context.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td width="50%"><strong>
                      <code class="language-cpp">void Agent::DisableModules(const wchar_t* const* const arrayOfRelativeOrFullPaths, size_t count, LppModulesOption options, void* callbackContext, LppFilterFunction* callback);</code>
                    </strong></td>
                    <td>Disables Live++ for the given modules (any mix of .exe and .dll) with the given options, filtering modules using an optional callback function and context.</td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
            </div>

            <p>Any modules disabled by these APIs must still be loaded into the process when the API is called. Again, the APIs themselves are non-blocking, thread-safe, and can be called from any thread at any time. Expected paths can either be absolute paths, or paths relative to the module that calls these APIs.</p>

            <p>When using any of the above APIs, make sure to use the same <strong><code class="language-cpp">LppModulesOption options</code></strong> that have been used when enabling the modules, otherwise e.g. import modules will not be disabled.</p>

            <p>Additionally, Agents offer an API that makes Live++ enable and disable modules automatically when they are loaded or unloaded, respectively:</p>

            <div class="table-responsive">
              <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
                <thead>
                  <tr>
                    <th>API</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td width="50%"><strong>
                      <code class="language-cpp">void Agent::EnableAutomaticHandlingOfDynamicallyLoadedModules(void* callbackContext, LppFilterFunction* callback);</code>
                    </strong></td>
                    <td>Makes Live++ handle dynamically loaded modules automatically: enabling them on load, disabling them on unload. All modules are filtered using an optional callback function and context.</td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
            </div>

            <p>Similar to other APIs, when using filter function callbacks, only modules for which the filter function returned <strong><code class="language-cpp">true</code></strong> will be enabled in Live++. Using a filter function gives you fine-grained control over which modules should be enabled and disabled automatically. Both arguments are optional, so passing <strong><code class="language-cpp">nullptr</code></strong> will not perform any filtering.</p>

            <p>Internally, the operation triggers the background compilation process. If compilation is successful it loads the new code into your application, linking it against existing code.

            <h3 id="unity_file_splitting">Unity splitting</h3>
            <p>
              Live++ will automatically detect and split unity/jumbo/blob files which are part of any registered module. For all such unity files, Live++ will split all included .cpp files into their own .obj file and use these for reconstruction and recompilation, as shown in the following example:
            </p>
            <p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// these are the contents of Unity.cpp:
#include "FileA.cpp"
#include "FileB.cpp"
#include "FileC.cpp"
</code></pre>
              In this example, Unity.cpp will be split into <strong>Unity.obj.lpp_split.FileA.obj</strong>, <strong>Unity.obj.lpp_split.FileB.obj</strong>, and <strong>Unity.obj.lpp_split.FileC.obj</strong>. This means that when a source file is changed and recompilation is triggered, Live++ only needs to recompile one smaller file instead of the main unity file. This results in much faster iteration times. The <strong>Compilands</strong> view also distinguishes between single-file, unity, and split compilands:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="assets/img/unity_compilands.png" alt="Live++ Unity compilands">
            </p>
            <p>
              Unity splitting can be controlled on a per-project basis by making use of the <a href="#project_preferences_unity_splitting">"Enable splitting of unity/jumbo/blob/amalgamated files"</a> setting. If you want more fine-grained control, you can enable unity splitting on a per-compiland basis, by setting <strong>LPP_FORCE_UNITY_SPLITTING</strong> as a preprocessor define in the command-line options for all compilands that you want to be split.

              <h4>Note</h4>
              <p>Unity splitting only has to be performed the first time any of the .cpp files included by a unity file is touched. Although this leads to the recompilation of every translation unit included by the unity file, in many cases this operation is as fast as recompiling the entire unity file, especially on modern multi-core machines.</p>

            <h3 id="halted_processes">Halted processes</h3>
            <p>
              Normally, Live++ will automatically gather modified files and start compilation in the background as soon as a hot-reload operation is scheduled. However, when a Live++-enabled process is held in the debugger (e.g. at a breakpoint), the process does not make any progress, so Live++ cannot communicate with it.
            </p>

            <h4>Visual Studio debugger</h4>
            <p>
              When debugging with Visual Studio, Live++ will attempt to automate the actions necessary to put the process into a mode where it can continue to communicate with Live++. If successful, the Broker UI log will read <strong>"Automated Visual Studio debugger attached to process with PID XXXXX"</strong>; Live++ will then compile your changes and install code patches. Afterwards, the process will once again be held at the same instruction in the debugger.
            </p>

            <h4>Other debuggers</h4>
            <p>
              If automation was unsuccessful, or if you are using other debuggers such as WinDbg, the UI log will read <strong>"Waiting for target process with PID XXXX. Hit 'Continue' (F5 in Visual Studio) if the process is being held in the debugger"</strong> upon scheduling a hot-reload operation. Resume your application and Live++ will compile and install any changes you made. Your process will still not execute new instructions until compilation is finished. Once patches have been installed by Live++, your process will automatically continue execution.
            </p>
            <p>
              The full sequence of events in this case is outlined below:
              <ol>
                <li>The debugger encounters a breakpoint and halts the process.</li>
                <li>Debugging commences as usual.</li>
                <li>You make one or several changes to the code currently being debugged/executed and invoke Live++ hot-reload.</li>
                <li>Live++ picks up modified files and waits for you to continue the process in the debugger.</li>
                <li>You continue the process, e.g. by pressing F5.</li>
                <li>Your process is still halted, but this time by Live++.</li>
                <li>Live++ compiles your changes, installs code patches and lets your process continue.</li>
                <li>Your process <a href="#limitation_functions_on_the_stack">continues execution where it left off</a>.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <div class="callout callout-info-MM" role="alert">
              <h4>Note</h4>
              <p>
                In this scenario, Live++ does not call any <a href="#API_hooks">hooks</a> you might have installed, because that could lead to a deadlock.

            <h3 id="natvis_visualizations">Natvis visualizations</h3>
            <p>
              Natvis visualizations are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/create-custom-views-of-native-objects" target="_blank">visualization rules for custom types</a>, understood by the Visual Studio debugger.
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually, <strong>.natvis</strong> files will be picked up by the debugger automatically for patches created by Live++. However, should that not be the case, it often helps to place these files into the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/create-custom-views-of-native-objects#BKMK_natvis_location" target="_blank">user-specific or system-wide Natvis directory</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, when compiling with Clang it is sometimes necessary to specify <strong>-fstandalone-debug</strong> as additional compiler option in the <a href="#project_preferences_compiler">project preferences</a> to ensure that Natvis information is not stripped from patches.

            <h2 id="tools_hot_restart">Hot-Restart</h2>
            <p>In order to combat build and link times that occur when closing and restarting an application, Live++ offers a mechanism for restarting applications while keeping loaded data and internal caches persistent.</p>
            <p>Once an application has entered its main loop, it has to be restarted in order to see the effect of changes made to e.g startup functions, which are called before entering the main loop. In this case, this usually entails the following sequence of events:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The user closes the application.
              </li>
              <li>
                The build system links the executable.
              </li>
              <li>
                The user starts the application again.
              </li>
              <li>
                Modules are enabled in Live++. This loads debug data from PDBs and builds internal caches.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Steps 2. and 4. can take a significant amount of time, especially on AAA projects. By making use of the Hot-Restart functionality provided by Live++, the situation can be improved considerably:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Live++ tells all interested processes to prepare for a restart.
              </li>
              <li>
                The processes run optional code in case they want to perform some kind of cleanup.
              </li>
              <li>
                Live++ restarts all interested processes, keeping all data loaded from PDBs as well as internal caches alive.
              </li>
              <li>
                Modules are enabled in Live++. This reuses existing debug data and caches, and installs previously compiled patches.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Notice how link times and Live++ loading times are almost completely eliminated when using the Hot-Restart mechanism.</p>

            <h3>Preparing for a restart</h3>
            <p>
              After a hot-restart has been requested, Live++ informs all interested processes that they should prepare for a restart. Your application is responsible for calling <strong><code class="language-cpp">WantsRestart()</code></strong> periodically (e.g. each frame), which will return true once a restart is requested. You can perform any optional cleanup (e.g. flush files) before initiating a restart.
            </p>


            <h3>Initiating a restart</h3>
            <p>
              As soon as your application has finished performing optional cleanup tasks, it is your responsibility to call <strong><code class="language-cpp">Restart(LppRestartBehaviour behaviour, unsigned int exitCode)</code></strong>. This signals Live++ that the process should be restarted, and thus exits the process. Any Visual Studio debugger attached to one of the restarted processes will automatically be reattached to the corresponding process by Live++ after the hot-restart operation has completed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The behaviour upon exiting depends on the <strong><code class="language-cpp">LppRestartBehaviour</code></strong> argument, as shown in the following table:
            </p>

            <p>
              Live++ offers powerful out-of-the-box error recovery via a custom <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/debug/vectored-exception-handling" target="_blank">Vectored Exception Handler (VEH)</a> that uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/debug/structured-exception-handling" target="_blank">Structured Exception Handling (SEH)</a> behind the scenes. Paired with the hot-reload capabilities of Live++, this often allows graceful recovery from otherwise fatal errors such as access violations, division by zero, and others. When using Live++'s exception handler, every time a process raises an unhandled exception (e.g. caused by an access violation), it will invoke this handler.
            </p>
            <p>
              In case a debugger such as Visual Studio is attached to the process, it will always get the first chance to handle an exception - this is ensured by the operating system.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="assets/img/exception_handler_vs.png" alt="Visual Studio exception handler">
            </p>
            <p>
              Continuing the process in the debugger will invoke Live++'s exception handler, which opens a dialog in the Broker that lets you decide how to deal with this exception:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="assets/img/exception_handler_broker.png" alt="Live++ exception handler">
            </p>
            <p>
              Double-clicking a line in the shown call stack will open the corresponding source file at this location in Visual Studio.
            </p>            
            <p>
              The options offered by the exception handler are as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>"Disable instruction":</strong><br/>
                  Completely disables the faulting machine instruction. This is a useful option if the exception comes from one of your own modules/source files that can be recompiled, but should never be used for e.g. 3rd-party code such as the Visual Studio Runtime.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>"Ignore instruction":</strong><br/>
                  Ignores the faulting machine instruction once. The next time the corresponding function is called, the instruction will cause the same exception unless the code has been recompiled in the meantime.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>"Leave function":</strong><br/>
                  Leaves the current function, continuing execution at the parent function. Additionally, if full SEH information is available, the stack will be unwound and local variables will have their destructors called.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>"Ignore exception":</strong><br/>
                  Ignores this exception once. This hands the exception to the next installed exception handler, if any. After the final installed exception handler has had a chance to handle the exception, the process will either stop in the debugger (if one is attached), or terminate.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              While the exception handler dialog is shown, you can change and recompile code using Live++ as usual. Note, however, that although new code will be installed in the background, process execution must <a href="#limitation_functions_on_the_stack">continue from the point of failure</a>, so you must still decide how to handle the exception in question.
            </p>

            <div class="callout callout-info-MM" role="alert">
              <h4>Note</h4>
              <p>
                In this scenario, Live++ does not call any <a href="#API_hooks">hooks</a> when recompiling code, because that could lead to a deadlock.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="callout callout-info-MM" role="alert">
              <h4>Hint</h4>
              <p>
                In order to make SEH information available in your executable, you need to enable the following compiler setting:
              </p>
              <p><span class="label label-default label-custom-MM">C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Enable C++ Exceptions -> Yes with SEH Exceptions (/EHa)</span></p>
              <p>
                SEH information is only required to unwind the stack when leaving the current function. If the exception handler does not have SEH exception information, it will still operate without any problems, but stack unwinding will not be performed.

            <h2 id="tools_hot_deoptimize">Hot-Deoptimize</h2>
            <p>
              Deoptimizing code on the fly helps you strike a balance between the debugability of your application and its iteration times. Unoptimized debug builds are much easier to debug than optimized retail builds, but are often too slow to use during development. On the other hand, optimized builds offer much better performance, but are much harder to debug.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to alleviate this, Live++ offers capabilities that make it easy to deoptimize code, debug the code, and go back to a fully optimized build - all in a running application.
            </p>
            <p>
              The options offered by Live++ are as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Select one or more files in the <strong>Compilands</strong> view in the Broker, right-click to open a context menu, and select <strong>"Toggle optimizations for selected compilands"</strong> to deoptimize the selected compilands instantly.
                </li>
                <li>Alternatively, compilands can be queued for later deoptimization by selecting <strong>"Queue selected compilands for deoptimization"</strong>. Deoptimization of queued compilands can be initiated by selecting the <strong>"Deoptimize queued"</strong> action.
                  <p>
                    <img src="assets/img/compilands_context_menu.png" alt="Compiland view context menu">
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can toggle the optimization state of the currently opened file by pressing the default shortcut <kbd><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd></kbd> in Visual Studio.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can also toggle a file's optimization state by putting the macro <strong>LPP_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS</strong> at the top of a file and hot-reloading the changes. The disadvantage of this approach is that the Live++ API <strong>"LivePP/API/x64/LPP_API_x64_CPP.h"</strong> needs to be visible in this file, and the deoptimized state cannot be tracked in the <strong>Compilands</strong> view.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Queued compilands can be dequeued again by selecting <strong>"Queue selected compilands for deoptimization"</strong> in the context menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once you want to revert all compilands back to their original optimization state, select the <strong>"Reoptimize all"</strong> action.
                </li>

            <p>With certain client/server and editor/game setups, it is tremendously helpful to be able to hot-reload changes into multiple processes or several instances of the same application at once. With Live++, this works out-of-the-box and does not require any kind of special setup.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Processes</strong> view in the Broker shows all processes currently registered with Live++:</p>

              <img src="assets/img/processes.png" alt="Processes view">
            </p>
            <p>
              All operations supported by Live++ will be carried out for affected or selected processes, no matter how many are registered. Live++ automatically makes sure that changes to any source files which are part of multiple modules or applications are compiled and hot-reloaded into all affected processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, Live++ will automatically inject all code changes into any subsequent instances of a Live++ application during load, resulting in new behaviour, even though the executable was never linked or changed on disk in the meantime. Subsequent changes to the code will then get hot-reloaded into all running processes, no matter at which point in time they were started.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Start the Broker on a local machine and note its host name or IP address shown in the window title, e.g. 192.168.8.147:</p>

            </ul>

            <p>
              In order for networked editing to work, applications on local machines must be started first, followed by applications on remote machines. However, Live++ will work with any mix of local and remote processes, and several instances of the same application on any machine.

            <p>
              Before you can use Live++, you first need to activate a license on your machine. In order to do this, start the Broker, select <span class="label label-default label-custom-MM">Licensing -> Activate...</span> from the main menu, and choose the platform and language for which you wish to activate a license, e.g. <strong>Windows, C++</strong>. This will open a dialog where you need to enter an activation code as well as a user ID:
            </p>

              <img src="assets/img/activate_license.png" alt="Broker license activation">
            </p>
            <p>The activation code was delivered to you upon purchasing Live++, and is a 12-character key in the form XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.</p>
            <p>
              The user ID can be freely chosen and identifies your license within the pool of licenses associated with the given activation code. This is needed in case you ever have to deactivate a license offline, e.g. because your machine was re-installed without deactivating an existing license first. Examples of common user IDs are <strong>"Jane home office"</strong> or <strong>"John laptop"</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>After pressing <strong>"OK"</strong> in the dialog, Live++ will try to contact the activation server using the data you entered. If the given activation code is valid, Live++ will generate a license that is tied to your machine and can only be used by you. In all other cases, an error will be displayed instead.</p>

            <div class="callout callout-info-MM" role="alert">
              <h4>Note</h4>

            <h2 id="licensing_deactivation">Deactivation</h2>
            <p>
              Should you need to deactivate a license, e.g. because your machine needs to be re-installed or you want to retire a license so that one of your co-workers can use it, navigate to <span class="label label-default label-custom-MM">Licensing -> Deactivate...</span> in the Broker main menu, and choose the platform and language for which you wish to deactivate a license, e.g. <strong>Windows, C++</strong>.

            <p>
              It is also possible to automate license activation and deactivation using the command-line tools found in the <strong>CLI</strong> directory of your Live++ installation. There is one tool for each combination of platform and language; for example, <strong>"LPP_License_x64_CPP.exe"</strong> is responsible for license management for <strong>Windows, C++</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Each tool understands the <strong>"--activate"</strong> and <strong>"--deactivate"</strong> options for license activation and deactivation, respectively. Consult the integrated <strong>"-h"</strong> help option for more information.</p>

              <h4>Note</h4>
              <p>Allowing Live++ to call hooks for halted processes is a potentially dangerous operation, since it might lead to a deadlock. For halted processes, Live++ always calls hooks from its receiver thread while all other threads in the process are suspended. Should any of the hooks try to lock a synchronization primitive such as a mutex while a suspended thread holds onto the same primitive, a deadlock will occur.</p>
              <p>Therefore, your hook implementation has to work under the assumption that any thread could be suspended at any time.</p>

            <h1 id="API">API</h1>
            <p class="lead">Live++ is pretty good at figuring things out, but it cannot do magic. The API lets you provide it with the help it needs to make certain scenarios work, and ships as several header files that can be used from both C and C++. However, client code only ever needs to include <a href="#directory_structure">one particular header file</a> for any platform and language.
            </p>
          </header>

          <section>
            <h2 id="API_naming_convention">Naming convention</h2>
            <p>
              In general, all API symbols share a common prefix. All macros begin with <strong>LPP_</strong>, while functions begin with <strong>Lpp</strong>. In C++, all functions are part of the <strong>lpp</strong> namespace to further reduce the chance of name clashes.
            </p>


            <h2 id="API_flavours">Flavours</h2>
            <p>
              All APIs which expect directories or paths are available in two flavours: ANSI versions taking a <strong><code class="language-cpp">const char*</code></strong> argument, and wide-character versions taking a <strong><code class="language-cpp">const wchar_t*</code></strong> argument.
            </p>


            <h2 id="API_versioning">Versioning</h2>
            <p>Live++ uses a simple versioning scheme to ensure that header files and the DLL are never out of sync. To achieve this, the header file defines the version of the API it expects to be exported by the DLL, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
#define LPP_VERSION "2.0.0"
</code></pre>

            <p>Internally, the DLL exposes a function that returns the API version it was built against, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
LPP_API const char* LppGetVersion(void);
</code></pre>

            <p>In addition, the DLL internally offers a function that performs the version check and returns whether the API and DLL versions match:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
LPP_API bool LppCheckVersion(const char* const expectedVersion);
</code></pre>

            <p>When <a href="#creating_default_agent">creating an agent</a>, these checks are automatically performed for you to ensure that the API and DLL versions always match.</p>

            <h2 id="API_structural_change">Structural changes</h2>
            <p>The following operations are considered "structural changes":

                <li>Changing the memory layout of a class declaration, which includes:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>adding or removing base classes</li>
                    <li>adding or removing non-static data members</li>
                    <li>changing the order of non-static data members</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Changing the layout or contents of virtual function tables, which includes:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>adding or removing polymorphic base classes</li>
                    <li>adding or removing virtual functions</li>
                    <li>changing the order of virtual functions</li>

            </p>
            <p>
              When making structural changes to existing code and data, Live++ has to make sure that new code can correctly work with existing data allocated and stored in an old memory layout. In order to do so, existing objects must have their data migrated from the old into the new memory layout, which can be achieved by using <a href="#API_hot_reload_hooks">pre-patch and post-patch hot-reload hooks</a>.
            </p>            
            <p>Hook statements can be put anywhere in the global scope and will be called automatically. You can add as many hooks as you like in whatever translation units you see fit: there is no limit to the number of hooks, or the number of files you can put hooks into.</p>
            <p>The following is a simplified example of how to perform data migration between patches:</p>
            
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
void MyOwnPrePatchHook(lpp::LppHotReloadPrepatchHookId, const wchar_t* const, const wchar_t* const* const, unsigned int, const wchar_t* const* const, unsigned int)
{
  serialization::SerializeAndDeleteObjects(g_allObjects, g_buffer);
}

void MyOwnPostPatchHook(lpp::LppHotReloadPostpatchHookId, const wchar_t* const, const wchar_t* const* const, unsigned int, const wchar_t* const* const, unsigned int)
{
  serialization::CreateAndSerializeObjects(g_allObjects, g_buffer);
}

LPP_HOTRELOAD_PREPATCH_HOOK(MyOwnPrePatchHook);
LPP_HOTRELOAD_POSTPATCH_HOOK(MyOwnPostPatchHook);
</code></pre>
            <p>The basic idea is always the same:
              <ol>
                <li>Serialize the data members of existing objects into memory.</li>
                <li>Delete the objects.</li>
                <li>Re-create the objects using the new class layout.</li>
                <li>Serialize the data members from memory to the new objects.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>How difficult or easy this is will depend on the setup and engine you use. You could also consider other alternatives, such as restarting or reloading the current level in a post-patch hook. You are free to use hooks however you see fit, to allow for unusual use-cases such as this.</p>

              <h4>Important</h4>
              <p>It is strongly advised to use a <a href="#creating_synchronized_agent">synchronized agent</a> to ensure that some objects don't have their memory layout changed while still being used. Keep in mind that objects created on the stack cannot be migrated to a new class layout.</p>

          <header>
            <h1 id="limitations">Limitations</h1>
            <p class="lead">The current version of Live++ has a few minor limitations which you should be aware of. Bear in mind, however, that unless noted otherwise these are not fundamental limitations of the Live++ infrastructure, but features which are planned but not yet available. Live++ will eventually lift these restrictions in a future update.</p>
          </header>

          <section>
            <h2 id="limitation_overhead">Overhead</h2>
            <p>
              As long as no Live++ code patch has been built and installed, the only runtime overhead caused by Live++ is due to the <a href="#linker_settings">/FUNCTIONPADMIN linker option</a> that inserts a few unused bytes before each function. However, the performance implication of this should be marginal, if measurable at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              For modules built with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/incremental-link-incrementally" target="_blank">incremental linking</a>, Live++ will automatically make use of the incremental linking thunks and patch function addresses directly. In this case, functions patched using Live++ do not cause any additional overhead at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              In all other cases, functions are patched using the hotpatch technique, which involves one short 2-byte jump as well as one relative jump to the new function.
            </p>


            <h2 id="limitation_breakpoints">Breakpoints in Visual Studio</h2>
            <p>
              When setting a new breakpoint in a source file that has been hot-reloaded by Live++, the Visual Studio debugger will try to apply this breakpoint to all patches which contain the corresponding source file. This can quickly become confusing, especially after adding new lines of code to an existing source file:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="assets/img/visual_studio_breakpoints.png" alt="Visual Studio breakpoints">
            </p>
            <p>
              As can be seen in the image above, setting a new breakpoint at <strong>line 20 in Cube.cpp</strong> will make the debugger set additional breakpoints in <strong>lines 21 and 22</strong> as well. Even though the breakpoints will work as expected since the old code is never actually hit, the red dots in the indicator margin can be misleading.
            </p>
            <p>
              To alleviate this, it is recommended to enable <span class="label label-default label-custom-MM">Require source files to exactly match the original version</span> under <span class="label label-default label-custom-MM">Tools -> Options... -> Debugging -> General</span> in Visual Studio.

              Because of how code patching in Live++ works, functions currently on the stack need to be re-entered before any of their code changes can be observed. In practice this is almost never a problem, and allows Live++ to correctly handle inline functions, introduce new stack variables into functions, and so on.
            </p>
            <div class="callout callout-info-MM" role="alert">
              <h4>Note</h4>
              <p>This is a limitation inherent to the patching mechanism used by Live++ and cannot be changed.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="limitation_thread_local_storage">Thread-local storage</h2>
            <p><strong>Using</strong> thread-local storage variables is fine, but <strong>introducing new</strong> global or static variables in thread-local storage is currently not supported.
            </p>

            <h2 id="limitation_clang_dynamic_initializers">Dynamic initializers in Clang</h2>
            <p>When compiling with Clang, introducing new global or static variables that require a dynamic initializer is not supported. The dynamic initializer will not be called in patches recompiled with Live++.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h2 id="known_issues_external">'/external:I' requires '/external:W'</h2>
            <p>
              In certain versions of Visual Studio, the toolchain does not correctly store the external include environment in the PDB file, as <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/trying-to-recompile-individual-files-with-pch-enab/1491579#T-N1618164" target="_blank">acknowledged by Microsoft</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the <strong>/external:I</strong> is ignored by the compiler in that case, it will most likely lead to missing includes during recompiles. As a workaround, specify <strong>/external:W0</strong> as additional compiler option in the <a href="#project_preferences_compiler">project preferences</a>.
            </p>


            <h2 id="known_issues_include">INCLUDE missing in PDB</h2>
            <p>
              Similar to the bug mentioned above, certain versions of Visual Studio also do not capture and store the INCLUDE environment in the PDB file, as <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/trying-to-recompile-individual-files-with-pch-enab/1491579#T-N1618164" target="_blank">acknowledged by Microsoft</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, this will lead to missing includes during recompiles. As a workaround, specify the required include paths as additional compiler options in the <a href="#project_preferences_compiler">project preferences</a>.
